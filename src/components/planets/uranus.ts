export const Uranus = () => new Planet(1.1, 38, new MeshStandardMaterial({ map: textureLoader.load(uranusTexture) }), 0.00006, { name: "Uranus", description: "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a gaseous cyan ice giant. Most of Uranus is made out of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. Uranus has a marked axial tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside Uranus's volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amount of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph), variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud formation. Uranus also has a very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still unexplained. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere. Uranus's ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light is reflected, and contains the known 13 inner moons. Further out are the larger 5 major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon; and orbit at much greater distance from Uranus are the known 9 irregular moons. Uranus magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may cause the darkening of its rings and moons." });
